# Grid numbers legend

The `gridNumberLegend.csv` file contains the legend for the grid numbers used in the experimental data files in the parent folder.

Each `Gird number` corresponds to a different pattern of four squares (`S1`-`S4`) in a grid of 4 x 4 squares.  The squares within the grid are numbered as follows:

$\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots & x_{1D} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots & x_{2D} \\
x_{31} & x_{32} & \ldots & x_{3D} \\ \end{array} \right]$
