# Grid numbers legend

`gridNumberLegend.csv` contains the legend for the grid numbers used in the experimental data files in the parent folder.

Each `Gird number` corresponds to a different pattern of four squares (`S1`-`S4`) in a grid of 4 x 4 squares.  The squares within the grid are numbered as follows:

                                             [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
                                             [ 5, 6, 7, 8]
                                             [ 9,10,11,12]
                                             [13,14,15,16]


For example, grid number `1`, assigned to the set of touched squares `{1,2,3,4}`, would correspond to the four squares on the top row of the grid.
