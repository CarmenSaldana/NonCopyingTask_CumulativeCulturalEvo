# Grid numbers legend

The `gridNumberLegend.csv` file contains the legend for the grid numbers used in the experimental data files in the parent folder.

Each `Gird number` corresponds to a different pattern of four squares (`S1`-`S4`) in a grid of 4 x 4 squares.  The squares within the grid are numbered as follows:

`[ 1, 2, 3, 4,

  5, 6, 7, 8,
  
  9,10,11,12,
  
 13,14,15,16 ]`
