# Visualisation of the response grid pattens

This folder contains visualisation of the response patterns produced by children and baboons in the `childrenGrids` and `baboonGrids` respectively. 

Grid patterns are colour coded to reflect the tetromino class each pattern comes from:

- `red`: lines
- `green`:  squares
- `blue`:  L-shapes
- `brown`: T-shapes
- `yellow`: S-shapes
- `black`: non-tetromino
